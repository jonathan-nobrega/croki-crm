# CRM Essentials

I have gathered the main features I find necessary for any business to run properly. Who are your clients? What projects are you working on? How much I am getting paid this month? If we can't get those questions answered quickly,  we're on a bad path. This project is looking to solve those simple but essential matters.

## The story behind it

I once tried to create an ERP for architects and interior designers - a very niched application. Back then I launched an MVP using low-code tools, but the project didn't go on. So I decided to finally build it from scratch using the tools I love - no low-code tools involved this time.

## Getting started

You can run it locally by running a NextJS server:

First, run the development server:

```bash
# install npm packages
npm install

# run development environment
npm run dev
```

Or checking the lattest production version at: [croki-crm.vercel.app](https://croki-crm.vercel.app/)
